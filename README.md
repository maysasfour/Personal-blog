Personal Blog Page üìù

About This Project  
This project is my implementation of the Personal Blog Page . It focuses on building a web page with HTML5 semantic structure, proper accessibility, and basic form handling. The blog page includes well-organized content sections, a contact form, and external links.

Features

1. Semantic HTML5 Structure 
- Utilized HTML5 semantic tags like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, and `<footer>` to ensure proper structure and improve page accessibility.  
- Added a `<title>` in the `<head>` section that reflects the content of the blog page.

2. Blog Content  
- **Article 1**: Includes a heading, a paragraph, and an image with `alt` text for accessibility.  
- **Article 2**: Contains a list with either an unordered (`<ul>`) or ordered (`<ol>`) list.  
- **External Links**: Added at least two hyperlinks to external websites that open in new tabs using `target="_blank"`.

3. Contact Form  
- The form includes the following fields:  
  - Full Name (text input, required, max length 50 characters).  
  - Email (email type, required).  
  - Gender (radio buttons for Male, Female, Other).  
  - Feedback (optional textarea, max length 200 characters).  
- HTML5 Validation: Form uses validation attributes like `required` and `max-length` to ensure user inputs meet the specified conditions.
